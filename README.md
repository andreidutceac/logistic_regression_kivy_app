Sports Injury Risk Assessment App

## Description
The Sports Injury Risk Assessment App is an interactive tool designed to estimate the risk of sports-related injuries for athletes. It utilizes a logistic regression model to predict injury risk based on user-inputted factors such as age, training hours, previous injuries, and fitness level. This Kivy-based app offers an intuitive interface for easy data entry and immediate risk assessment, making it a valuable tool for athletes, coaches, and sports health professionals.

## Features
- User-Friendly Interface:Built with Kivy, the app provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input data.
- Custom Logistic Regression Model: Implements a logistic regression algorithm to calculate the probability of injury based on user inputs.
- Real-Time Risk Assessment: Instantly evaluates injury risk upon data submission and displays the risk category (High Risk or Low Risk).
- Versatile Use: Suitable for a range of sports and athlete profiles.

## How It Works
- Data Input: Users enter their age, training hours per week, number of previous injuries, and fitness level on a scale of 1-10.
- Risk Calculation: The app applies a logistic regression model to these inputs to estimate the injury risk.
- Display Results: The calculated risk is displayed as either 'High Risk' or 'Low Risk', giving users immediate feedback.

Installation and Usage
- Prerequisites: Python environment with Kivy installed.
- Running the App: Clone the repository, navigate to the app's directory, and run the Python script.

Development and Customization
- Model Training: The logistic regression model can be trained on a larger, sport-specific dataset for more accurate predictions.
- Customization: Developers can adjust the logistic regression model, tweak the UI, or add more features as needed.
